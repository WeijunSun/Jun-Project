  <h4>Interest in IT</h4>
  <p>In recent years, one of the hottest topics of IT definitely is AI. After I tried those innovative inventions, I was attracted by AI deeply. I believe this technology will greatly change our lifestyle in a short period. Also, AI is a double-sword technology invention. We do not know which direction it will be developed. For example, 4G, because of it, we can watch 1080P video in our mobile phone, we can use 4G to watch or post live broadcast, we also can use 4G to play games like PUBG. However, some people might use 4G to spy other people or addiction to the games. AI is the same, it not only can bring many conveniences for us, but also can bring negative effect to us. For example, become a lazy person. Because of these things, I want to learn more about AI. I want to create AI which can improve our life and bring positive changes. 

13, 04, 2017, Stephen Hawking warned the scientific community that AI might become the biggest disaster in human history. He thinks that although AI can bring huge benefits. However, it also can pose dangers. For example, the powerful autonomous weapons owned by the terrorist. Or help a few people who own this powerful invention to oppress other people. Or AI has their own mind and against human being’s wishes. This event is the fuse that makes me decide to learn this major. 

In 2018, I learned language C in RMIT Foundation Studies. This is the beginning of my programming life. 

I choose RMIT because in 2017 summer vacation, I came to Melbourne as a visitor, my aunty introduces the RMIT to me. When I first time saw the building 80, I was shocked by this building, at first, I even do not recognize that this is a university. The buildings are so fancy, it also located in the city. After this travel, I find a lot of interesting things about RMIT on the internet. The most important thing is the facilities are advance and the comment of past RMIT student is pretty good. So I selected this university to learn IT.

About what I want to learn during the studies. First of all, I want to learn the basic programming knowledge, understand what computer and the principle are how can hardware understanding codes. After I learn this foundation knowledge, I want to choose the direction of AI that can make me deeply understand this advance technology. Finally, also the most importantly is learning how to learn independently, how to self-study.</p>

  <h5>Ideal Job</h5>
  <p>I want a job that can let me programming for the robot. I choose this area of job because use the code to make a machine like a creature is quite interesting, which means I can have a great working environment to do my project. Moreover, In China, AI definitely is the biggest trend in the IT industry and for the next few years, which means the job will easier to find than other jobs in the IT industry. Naturally, the salary for it should be a nice and big amount.

    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>The name of this job position is machine learning engineer. I believe that the working environment might suit for me because I might can get a positive work and the salary of it is great. Also, I prefer to enjoy my work rather than hate it. I do not want work becomes to work. I think this job can makes me happy when I do the work. I not only can use my IT knowledge and learning new knowledge in this area, but also can help patients to get higher quality service. It is makes me proud because I can use my knowledge to help other people.

It requires the job applicant have at least bachelor degree and:
•	One or more in C/C++, JAVA, Python, Scale
•	The skills of communication property
•	The ability that can read codes fast and efficiency
•	The ability to deploying workflows
•	The knowledge about large-scale integration and the mothed to implement AI
•	The ability to develop and utilize machine learning API services
•	The experience that using machine learning, deep learning models and deploying models to production environments
•	The applicant must have good work with team, pay attention to the details, solve problems efficiency, flexible and do not self-isolated.

For now, I only have the basic C language skill and English communication skill. 

I still need to improve my communication ability because English is my second language. Also, in order to meet the requirement of this job. I need to learn deeper about C language and begin to study a new language: Python. There are many online programming guide applications I can use. RMIT also helped us to subscribe a great programming self-study website which is Grok Milestone. After these steps, I will start to find which elective courses can I select to learn AI and view each course what kind of knowledge I will learn. Because when I finish this step, I can find the relevant information to preview. When I done those plans, I should already have the fundamental IT knowledge. So I need to start to find internship to gain the working experience. </P>
